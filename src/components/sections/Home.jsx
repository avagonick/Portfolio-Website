                 Hi! I'm Ava Gonick, a Computer Science Master's student at UC San Diego. I'm passionate about building tools with real-world impact, from improving clinical trial data quality control in support of drug development at Neurocrine Biosciences to developing surgical risk prediction machine learning models at UCLA. My work spans software development, data science, and machine learning all rooted in the belief that technology should serve people. As a UCSD Graduate Women in Computing chair, Iâ€™m also dedicated to advancing diversity in tech and supporting my community through leadership and mentorship.
